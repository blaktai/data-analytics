## Step 1.2: Explore Your Data
It’s time to get to the interesting bits. Explore your data and document your findings in a report. The report should briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that you conducted. You should have headers and text that organize your thoughts and findings. Visualizations in this part of the project need not be completely polished: this is just your own exploration at this point. However, you should still make sure that you adhere to principles of using appropriate plot types and encodings so that accurate conclusions can be drawn, and that you have enough comments and labeling so that when you return to your work, you can quickly grasp your analysis steps.

If you use a Jupyter Notebook for this step of the project, don’t forget to export the notebook as an html file for the project submission.

## Step 2.1: Document your Story
At the end of your exploration, you probably have a bunch of things that you’ve discovered. Now it’s time to organize your findings and select a story that you will convey to others. In your readme document, you should summarize your main findings and reflect on the steps you took in your data exploration. You should also lay out the key insights that you want to convey in your explanatory report as well as any changes to visualizations, or note new visualizations that will be created to bridge between your insights.

## Step 2.2: Create your Slide Deck
Follow the plans you laid out in the previous step and create a slide deck with explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored. You can start with code that you used in your exploration, but you should make sure that the code is revised so that your plots are polished. Make sure that you also pay attention to aspects of design integrity in your revisions.

## Step 2.3: (Optional) Get Feedback
Though not required, it is highly recommended that you try to get feedback from at least one person before you submit your project. By sharing your work with others, you can get input from a different perspective that catches things that you may have originally missed. Share your slide deck with someone in person and have them provide live feedback on what they get from your slide deck. Alternatively, you can also share your work with your fellow students. Post a message in a student community channel for this project with a link to your project and ask for feedback. Be sure to keep an eye out for others who are also seeking feedback and return the favor!

You might need to ask specific questions to prompt your reader. The following questions might be good starters; be sure to follow up or come up with your own questions:

1. What do you notice about each visualization?
2. What questions do you have about the data?
3. What relationships do you notice?
4. What do you think is the main takeaway from the slide deck?
6. Is there anything that you don’t understand from the plots?
5. If you get feedback from others, then add their feedback to your readme document. Note what changes you make to your slide deck and designs based on that feedback. You can also include feedback from your reviewer as part of this revision process.

## Step 2.4: Review and Submit the Project
There’s one last thing to do before you submit your project. You should closely read the project rubric, which your reviewer will use to evaluate your work. Perform a self-review to assess the quality of your work. If there is any rubric point on which you don’t feel confident, then go back and make improvements before submitting your project for review. In fact, it’s a good idea to look at the project rubric now, before you get started. This way, you have a clear idea of what points to aim for as you go through the project steps.
